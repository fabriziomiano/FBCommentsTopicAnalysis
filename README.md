# FBPostTopicAna
Facebook-page post basic topic analysis

## What is it?
A simple tool to run a basic, very simple, 
topic analysis on owned facebook-page.

#### How does it do it?
It gets the data of given posts by calling
the Facebook GraphAPI. It performs standard NLP preprocessing
(tokenization, stopwords filtering, stemming) and makes plots:
a wordcloud plot and a bar plot of the N most important words.
The tool can be configured as one sees fit.  

## How to install 
It requires Python3+ and `virtualenv`. 
With these two installed, one can simply clone the repo
and run `source install.sh`


## How to run
Coming soon as I'm still changing my mind
